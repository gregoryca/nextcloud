Ignore this readme, still needs to updated to reflect the official nextcloud docker image instead of: Linuxserver.io

Copy and paste the following file: default into the following folder location: /nextcloud/data/appdata/nginx/
Afterwards it should look like: /nextcloud/data/appdata/nginx/default

Next set the traefik loadbalancer port to: 80

If the necessary secrets are defined, you could also do a Ansible deployment of the Nextcloud Docker stack.
