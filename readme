create a ansible.cfg in: /deployments/
The contents of the ansible.cfg are as following:

[defaults]

inventory = inventory

host_key_checking = true

Next you'll need a inventory file so ansible knows how to connect to your infra for proivisioning.
The contents of the inventory file are as follow:

[name group]
server name ansible_host=ipaddress ansible_port=port

[group name:vars]

What also is important is to create a .env file in the root directory of your docker-compose file, and add the missing details in the .env file.
more details follow soon !











Ignore this readme, still needs to updated to reflect the official nextcloud docker image instead of: Linuxserver.io

Make sure you define a config.php file for nextcloud like so: https://help.nextcloud.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9d28662b6e5090c46a48e034b66f214904738e6b.png

If the necessary secrets are defined, you could also do a Ansible deployment of the Nextcloud Docker stack.
